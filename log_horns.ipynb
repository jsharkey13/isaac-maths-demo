    "### Plotting a horn\n",
    "\n",
    "We now define a function `draw_log_horn()` that, given the horn's parameters, will create a plot.\n",
    "The two key parameters to explore are $b$ and $w_0$ and so these have to be given each time the function is called, others can be left with sensible default values at least to start with. These default values means we can call the function without providing them. Some, like $\\alpha$ only make sense in specific ranges: $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 2\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python if we want to use the constant $\\pi = 3.14159265..$ we can either define it ourselves or, better, use a constant from a library like NumPy; in this case since we've imported NumPy as `np`, we can get the constant $\\pi$ using `np.pi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We name our variables after the Greek letters and use an underscore to denote subscripts: $\\alpha$ becomes `alpha`, $\\theta$ becomes `theta`, $w_0$ becomes `w_0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One parameter of the function we're going to define has nothing to do with the maths itself, but is instead part of our computational model: `divisions_per_radian`. In order to make a 3D plot, we need to sample the surface at many points and this allows us to adjust how many. A real function has a value at every point in space, but computers cannot cope with an infinite number of values, so we limit how many samples we use. Too few, and the plot will look rough and unlike the real function; too many and our code will never be able to work out all of the values required and may crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The star (or asterix, `*`) as the first argument of the function definition means that arguments to this function have to be passed by name; so `draw_log_horn(0.2, 0.5)` will not work, and we have to be clear what number is what: `draw_log_horn(b=0.2, w_0=0.5)`."

These are given as arguments when we call the function we've just defined. Some of the function parameters have default values which means we don't have to specify them every time, but can provide them to override the defaults if we want to see what happens. So we'll start with `draw_log_horn(b=0.2, w_0=0.5)`.\n",
